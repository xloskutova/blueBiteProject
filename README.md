Cypress.io is used to demonstrate my ability to build a simple automation framework from scratch and write test scripts utilizing JS and following POM design to store all the elements and expected results separately from the actual tests.

Reporter:
I used Junit reporter that will show a report in the console after the test run and generate xml report file in temp folder.
Use command: npm run test

It will provide screenshots and video in the temp folder in case the test fails. I include a couple of tests that are failing due to the defect in the app for demo purposes.

If you want to see the whole Cypress flow run command: npx cypress open

PLEASE NOTE:
There is a typo in successful submission message in the word “registed”, but in my tests i write it like this as expected so you can see how i approach the validation:

Submission Confirmed, Dave
The winner of the raffle will be managed independently and will be contacted via email. You have `registed` “number” submissions.
